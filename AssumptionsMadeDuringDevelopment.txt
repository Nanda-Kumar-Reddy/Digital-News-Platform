Assumptions Made During Development:

User Authentication:

Email and password-based authentication is sufficient for the current implementation.

Passwords will be stored in a hashed format using a secure algorithm (e.g., bcrypt) before saving in the database.

Notification Settings:

All users start with default notification preferences:

Breaking News: Enabled

Daily Digest: Enabled

Personalized Alerts: Enabled

Users can update these preferences anytime.

Push Notifications:

Device tokens provided by users are valid and correctly linked to their account.

For web, browser push notifications will be used; for mobile, FCM/APNs integration is assumed in the future.

Article Management:

Articles are inserted by an admin or trusted source (no user-generated content).

Each article belongs to one category (e.g., politics, sports, tech).

Data Integrity:

Each user can bookmark the same article only once (unique constraint handled in code or database).

Deleting a user will automatically remove all related bookmarks and notification settings.

Scalability:

SQLite is used for development purposes. For production, migration to PostgreSQL or MySQL is assumed.

Current design assumes a moderate amount of traffic suitable for a single database instance.

Security:

JWT tokens are assumed to be securely stored in the client (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or secure storage).

No additional OAuth (Google, Facebook) login is included in this phase.

Time Zone & Localization:

All timestamps are stored in UTC format in the database.

No multi-language support in the current version; English is the default language.

Device Registration:

One user can have multiple devices registered for notifications.

Device tokens remain valid unless explicitly removed by the user.
